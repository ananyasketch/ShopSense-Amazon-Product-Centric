# ShopSense-Amazon-Product-Centric
Our creative ShopSense provides a fresh method for expediting the retrieval of important product details and user opinions by tackling the issue of information overload. This project goes above and beyond the call of duty by presenting a multifunctional solution that retrieves product details and prices but also allows for the visualization of whole product lines according to brand and the extraction of subtle insights from user feedback. Our solution combines web scraping techniques with artificial intelligence to provide consumers with easy access to full information so they can make informed decisions. In addition, the project's emphasis on extracting important insights—such as sentiment analysis and influential viewpoints—brings a level of sophistication to the traditional method of retrieving product information.
